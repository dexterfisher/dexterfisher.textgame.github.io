<p style="color:yellow;font-size:50px;">As your walking through your yard, you stop, dead in your tracks. Your heart pounds and your mind races as you pat your pockets in fear. Your favorite bracelet is missing. Your eyes fill with tears as you try to remeber where you left it. The last place you remember wearing it was getting off the schoolbus. The rain pounds down on your back as you step into your doorway that leads into your living room. You stand there, where could the bracelet be?</p>
